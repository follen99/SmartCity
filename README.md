## What Are Smart Cities?
A **smart city** is a place where traditional networks and services are made more **efficient** with the use of **digital solutions** for the benefit of its inhabitants and business.

A smart city goes beyond the use of digital technologies for **better resource** use and **less emissions**. It means smarter urban transport networks, upgraded water supply and waste disposal facilities and more efficient ways to light and heat buildings. It also means a more interactive and responsive city administration, safer public spaces and meeting the needs of an ageing population.

## My Goal
As we can see from the **Smart City** definition, the main goal is to have a **safer** and **cleaner** city.
A way to achieve that is by monitoring the `CO2` in the air and using `using less resources`, turning lights down when we do not need them or limiting car traffic when the `CO2` levels are too high.

A really important factor is to `understand` **when** and **why** some levels are too high, so a method to fix too high `CO2` values is by **logging** whenever there is an event, to **analyze** the data later.

## The Code
We can **monitor** the **air quality** via a `CO2` detector:
